## Reordering and renaming columns
Many operations in OpenRefine are accessed from the drop down menus at the top of each column. You can re-order the columns by clicking the drop down menu at the top of the first column (labelled 'All'), and choosing 'Edit columns->Re-order / remove columns â€¦'

You can then drag and drop column names to re-order the columns, or remove columns completely if they are not required.

## Sorting data
You can sort data in OpenRefine by clicking on the drop down menu for the column you want to sort on, and choosing 'Sort'

Once you have sorted the data a new 'Sort' drop down menu will be displayed.

Unlike Excel 'Sorts' in OpenRefine are temporary - that is, if you remove the 'Sort', the data will go back to it's original 'unordered' state. The 'Sort' drop down menu lets you amend the existing sort (e.g. reverse the sort order), remove existing sorts, and make sorts permanent.

You can sort on multiple columns at the same time by adding another sorted column (in the same way).
